steps and process:
1. Authentication with Google Cloud
	Authentcating the user in the google Cloud
2. Accessing the Google Sheet
	Accessing the datset using the google sheet
3. Converting Data to a Pandas DataFrame
	using pandas reading the csv dataframes
4. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
	Dropping and Renaming Columns. 
	Converting Columns to Numeric.
	Additional Cleaning.
5. Handling Missing Values
	Displays the count of missing values by ignoring errors
6. Encoding the Target Variable
	Encodes categorical target labels in the "Level" column into numerical values.
7. Splitting Data into Features and Target
	Splits the dataset into features (x) and the target (y).
8. Feature Scaling
	Standardizes the features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
9. Splitting Data into Training and Testing Sets
	Splits the dataset into training and testing subsets.
	30% of the data is used for testing.
10. Training a Random Forest Classifier
	Trains a Random Forest classifier on the training data.
	Predicts the target labels for the test data.
11. Model Evaluation
Accuracy : claculating the overall accuracy
Confusion Matrix : Displays the confusion matrix to evaluate classification performance.
Classification Report : Generates a detailed report showing precision, recall, F1-score, and support for each class.
12. Output Results
	Accuracy of the random forest classifier
	Confusion Matrix
	Classification report

Summary :
	1.Accessing and preprocessing data from Google Sheets.
	2.Cleaning and preparing data for analysis.
	3.Training and evaluating a machine learning model (Random Forest Classifier).
	4.Generating performance metrics.
